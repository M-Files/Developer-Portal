This Privacy Policy (together with our <a href="https://www.m-files.com/en/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents referred to in it) describes how we collect, store, use and disclose personal data (defined below) from individuals who use our products, services and website located at <a href="https://www.m-files.com">www.m-files.com</a> and its subdomains (collectively the "Site") (the Site and all other products and services provided by us together, the "Services"). In this statement, the term "personal data" means information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.

Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device's hard disk. M-Files may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic on the Site, and to improve the Site and related Services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and is deleted from your device when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

We use Google Analytics for usage tracking. Google Analytics collects and stores data on your use of the Services, including without limitation time of visit, Site pages visited or opened and for how long are they used, the Internet Protocol (IP) address and information on the device used to access the Site. We may also use other third party data analytics service providers. These service providers may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services. Analytics service providers enable us to collect, monitor and analyze data regarding the use of the Services, in order to understand how users use the Services and to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of the Services, as well as to better tailor the Services to usersâ€™ needs. Accordingly, some automatically collected data is shared with such third party service providers, who have their own privacy policies applicable to their operations.
