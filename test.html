        M-Files' powerful approach to Enterprise Content Management allows businesses to work with what content is, instead of where it's saved.  This powerful metadata-based approach
        can be used to easily design, build and deploy systems that support businesses in almost any sector, of almost any size.  Whilst M-Files' out-of-the-box functionality allows deep
        integration with various platforms and technologies, it also has a broad set of developer-orientated approaches which can be used to extend this even further.

        We call this <b>M-Files as a Platform</b>.
