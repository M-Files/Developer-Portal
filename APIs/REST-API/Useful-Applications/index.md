## Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a standalone application for building, testing and diagnosing API requests for REST-like web services.  Postman can be used to manually build HTTP web requests (including HTTP headers and body content), to execute the requests, and to analyse the response.

Additionally, a [Postman collection is included within our GitHub repository](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Libraries/Postman/#readme).  This collection can be used to interact with the M-Files Web Service more easily.

## Telerik Fiddler

[Telerik Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a web debugging proxy.  Fiddler can be used to monitor HTTP/HTTPS traffic to investigate the requests and responses.
