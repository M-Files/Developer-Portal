## Conciseness and Consistency

* Stay concise. Consider what the user absolutely needs to know and leave out any non-essential details.
    * If the issue or topic is especially complex, instruct the user to see supplemental material.

Electronic signing is not be available because the necessary metadata definitions for creating signature objects have not been set. For more information, refer to the M Files user guide. | Electronic signing will not be available because the required metadata definitions for creating signature objects have not been set. In order for automatic signature objects to be created in M-Files, aliases must be created for the new object type as well as for the required property definitions. The aliases are used for creating objects at the time of signing. If you are using M-Files Compliance Kit, these definitions should already be available. Otherwise, you should create the required metadata definitions in M-Files Admin in order to activate the separate signature objects.

* Stay consistent. Always use the same terms for the same elements. This makes it a lot easier for the users to find their way around the user interface.

## Tone and Voice of User Interface Texts

This section applies to user interface texts only.
{:.note}

* Keep the texts casual, polite, and friendly.
    * Use _sorry_ and _please_ if it feels natural to do so.
    * Feel free to use contractions like _don't, shouldn't, we're,_ and so on.
    * Do not, however, use abbreviations such as _etc., e.g.,_ and _i.e._

<span style="color: green">Sorry, but we couldn't get</span> you the most recent version. | The most recent version <span style="color: red">is unavailable.</span>
<span style="color: green">Please try again</span> later. | The operation <span style="color: red">can be attempted again </span> at a later time.

* If you have to choose, be easily understandable rather than colorful and exciting. In most cases, however, being clear does not automatically mean that you need to also sound flat and uninteresting
