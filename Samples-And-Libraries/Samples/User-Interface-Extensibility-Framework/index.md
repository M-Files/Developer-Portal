M-Files has published a number of public samples within our [MFilesSamplesAndLibraries GitHub repository](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Samples#readme), which focus on achieving specific tasks using our public APIs or Frameworks.

* [Hello, World (ShellUI)](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Samples/UIX%20Applications/HelloWorld)

A [User Interface Extensibility Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/) application that creates a basic UIX ShellUI application - consisting of an appdef.xml and a single module - that displays a message when the shell frame object becomes available for use.

* [Commands (ShellUI)](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Samples/UIX%20Applications/Commands)

A [User Interface Extensibility Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/) application that creates two commands that interact with each other.

* [Open External Application On Command (ShellUI)](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Samples/UIX%20Applications/OpenExternalApplicationOnCommand/#readme)

A [User Interface Extensibility Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/) application that adds a command (button) to the task area and context menu, opening Notepad when the button is clicked.
