The following samples do not necessarily utilise one specific technology, but are samples of implementing specific processes using M-Files APIs and Frameworks:

[Copying Objects](Copying-Objects) | [GitHub](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Samples/Processes/CopingObjects) | An example (available as both a [Vault Application Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/Vault-Application-Framework/) application, and a [VBScript]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/VBScript/) implementation) showing how to create a copy of an object, including all files.  Typically used as part of a workflow.
[Chaining Workflows](Chaining-Workflows) | [GitHub](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Samples/ChainWorkflows#readme) | An example (available as both a [Vault Application Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/Vault-Application-Framework/) application, and a [VBScript]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/VBScript/) implementation) that shows how to move an object from one workflow to another once it reaches a specific state in a workflow.  This technique can be used to split complex workflows into smaller, more managable processes for staff.
[Client to Server Communication](Client-To-Server-Communication) | [GitHub](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries/tree/master/Samples/Processes/ClientToServerCode) | An example of a client-side [User Interface Extensibility Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/) application that calls a server-side [Vault Extension Method]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/VBScript/Vault-Extension-Methods/), then displays the results of the call.
