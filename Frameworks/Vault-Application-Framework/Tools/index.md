M-Files provide a number of tools aimed at supporting developers building Vault Application Framework applications:

## [Microsoft Visual Studio Developer Tools](Visual-Studio)

M-Files provide various tools, including a [Visual Studio Project template](Visual-Studio/Template), and [Code Snippets](Visual-Studio/Code-Snippets) for use with [Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

## [Other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)](Other-IDEs)

M-Files also provide [templates compatible with the `dotnet new` project templating system](Other-IDEs).  Other IDEs such as [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) have support for these templates, or the templates can be used from the command line to create a project that can then be built, debugged, and maintained using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
