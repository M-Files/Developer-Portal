## Visual Studio Vault Application Framework project template

The Vault Application Framework 22.12 project template was released in late 2021, and can be used to create applications for M-Files 20.5 upwards.  A [detailed walkthrough shows how to use the VAF 2.3 template](Template).

## Legacy templates

Templates for older versions of the VAF are included in the [M-Files Visual Studio Template Package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=M-Files.MFilesVisualStudioExtensions), although these should only be used when specifically targeting older versions of M-Files.  More information is avalable in the [legacy section]({{ site.baseurl }}/Legacy/Vault-Application-Framework).
