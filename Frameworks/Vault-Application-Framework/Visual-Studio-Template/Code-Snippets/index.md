[Visual Studio Code Snippets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165392.aspx) are small blocks of reusable code that can be inserted into a code file using a context menu or set of key-presses.  Code Snippets can be used to quickly create commonly-used code structures such as methods or properties, reducing the amount of code that developers must type to do so.
