## Debugging

Vault Application Framework applications can be [easily debugged from within Visual Studio](Debugging).

[Exceptions can be thrown from within Vault Application Framework applications](Exceptions) to replicate the functionality of `Err.Raise` in VBScript.  Exceptions are typically shown to the user as a message box, and the current vault transaction rolled back.
