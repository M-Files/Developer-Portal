User Interface Extensibility Framework applications are a combination of a number of text files (one [application definition file]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/Application-Definition/), one or more [modules]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/Modules/), and zero or more [dashboards]({{ site.baseurl }}/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/Dashboards/).  This section shows how to create some basic User Interface Extensibility Framework applications, and links to the associated source code within our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/M-Files/MFilesSamplesAndLibraries).

## Available samples and tutorials

* [Hello, World (ShellUI)](HelloWorld)
