---

The User Interface Extensibility Framework (UIX) was created to allow developers to build client-side applications that interact with the M-Files Desktop and M-Files Web Access.  

<p class="note">A <a href="https://www.m-files.com/UI_Extensibility_Framework/">technical reference</a> website is available which provides detailed information such as interface members.  This website focuses instead on the practicalities of developing applications using the UIX.</p>

## Application Structure

User Interface Extensibility Framework applications consist of a number of text and binary files, deployed in a `.zip` or `.mfappx` package (an `.mfappx` package is simply a renamed zip file and is used to easily identify deployable M-Files applications).
