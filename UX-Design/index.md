This document is intended to brief developers on the design principles of the M-Files UI, and to introduce the UI components used in desktop development. It targets to M-Files partners and developers who are developing applications or services that need to integrate their "look and feel" with M-Files.

## Design Principles

M-Files 2018 contains a renewed user interface in the desktop client. The following design principles have been followed to guarantee excellence in practice of user experience throughout platforms:

### Engaging

"Engaging" simply means ensuring that the experience is pleasant enough that the user is willing to come back to the application or product. One of the most important factors of it is to make onboarding as awesome an experience as possible. An engaging product is intuitive and easy to use, whilst fulfilling the purpose it was created for. Familiarity, personality, ease of use and responsiveness are the main aspects of an engaging experience.

### Familiar

The more familiar we are with something, the less cost for our cognitive processes to kick in and figure out how to respond. Familiarity leads to automatic response. The "+" symbol, often used to symbolize creation/addition of a new item is another classic example of design incorporating familiar concepts.  Using familiar patterns, icons, and presentational styles is a great way to look native, even if you're not.

### Personal

Customization, in this context, allows users to configure the look and feel according to their needs. This can be reflected in changes to the order of icons, color, or even application themes, etc.
Personalization, however, also involves the interpretation of user's needs according to how he or she utilizes the device, and adjusting accordingly.
