## Design Principles

M-Files has a renewal for its user interface of M-Files 2018 release. Here are couple of design principles, which have been followed in design process to guarantee excellence in practice of user experience throughout platforms.

### Engaging

Simplest form of engaging means the experience to be pleasant enough for user willing to come back to the application or product. One of the most important factors of it, is to make onboarding as awesome an experience as possible. Engaging product is intuitive and easy to use whilst it fulfills the purpose it was created for. Familiarity, personality, ease of use and responsiveness are the main aspects of an engaging experience.

### Familiar

The more familiar we are with something, the less cost for our cognitive processes to kick in and figure out how to respond to that. Familiarity leads to automatic response. The "+" symbol, often used to symbolize creation/addition of a new item is another classic example of design incorporating familiar concepts.  Using familiar patterns, icons, and presentational styles is a great way to look native, even if you're not.

### Personal

Customization, in this context, allows users to configure the look and feel according to their needs. This can be reflected in changes to the order of icons, color, or even application themes, etc.
Personalization, however, also involves the interpretation of user's needs according to how he or she utilizes the device, and adjusting accordingly.
