title: External Object Type Data Sources
---

Many organisations already have systems in place that contain business-critical or business-important information.  Whilst it's useful to have this information within M-Files, the organisation may already have a CRM (containing customers and contacts), an ERP (containing orders and supply details), or any number of other systems of record.  Marking individual object types as "External" allows M-Files to retrieve these objects from the remote systems automatically, reducing end-user workload.

M-Files can retrieve content from various systems:

* [ODBC-compatible data sources]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/External-Object-Type-Data-Source/ODBC/)
* [Microsoft Dynamics CRM]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/External-Object-Type-Data-Source/Dynamics-CRM/)
* [Salesforce]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/External-Object-Type-Data-Source/Salesforce/)
* [Any other system, via custom providers]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/External-Object-Type-Data-Source/Custom/)
