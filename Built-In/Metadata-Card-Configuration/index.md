title: Metadata Card Configuration

Since M-Files 2015.1, M-Files has provided a JSON-based mechanism for controlling some elements of the metadata card within the M-Files Desktop and M-Files Web interfaces.  Through the M-Files Admin software, administrators can define a hierarchy of "rules", each of which consist of a set of "conditions" and the resultant "behaviour".  When the metadata card is displayed, if the conditions are met then the behaviour is executed.

For example:
* A condition may be "The object type is 'Project', and its 'Priority' is 'High'".
* A behaviour may be "Add a header image to reflect the project priority, and add a description at the top of the metadata card".

This would result in a header image - along with some text - being shown at the top of the metadata card for high-priority projects.

<p class="note">Note that the M-Files Web interface does not currently support all configuration features of the M-Files Desktop client.  More information is available in the <a href="https://kb.cloudvault.m-files.com/Default.aspx?#3ECA226F-7B54-428B-B539-DE443E6134EC/object/E3847E26-5635-4386-A189-B9086FC9BEBA/latest">M-Files Desktop vs. M-Files Web comparison document</a>.</p>
