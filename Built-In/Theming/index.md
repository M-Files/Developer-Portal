## M-Files Desktop UI Theme

Since M-Files 10.1, it has been possible to update the colours, logos and fonts within the M-Files Desktop client.  Each vault can be provided with a customised theme, which is installed via the M-Files Admin tool.

More information is available within our [online knowledgebase](https://kb.cloudvault.m-files.com/Default.aspx?#3ECA226F-7B54-428B-B539-DE443E6134EC/object/689E6077-AF09-48C5-8AA8-C3A6821FCB26/latest).

### M-Files Metadata Card

Since M-Files 2015.1, it has also been possible to alter the theme of the metadata card.  More detailed information is available [in the Metadata Card Configuration page]({{ site.baseurl }}/Built-In/Metadata-Card-Configuration/).

## M-Files Web Theme

The M-Files Desktop UI theme does not affect the UI in M-Files Web.  To modify the theme in M-Files Web, the graphics and CSS within the web root must be altered directly.  These changes affect the entire M-Files Web user interface and, as such, cannot be targeted at specific vaults.
